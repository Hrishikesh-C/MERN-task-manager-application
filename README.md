Task Management Application
A flexible, user-centric task management platform built with the MERN stack that allows users to create, organize, and customize their workflow according to their specific needs.
Overview
This application empowers users to take control of their productivity through seamless organization and customization. Create, track, and modify tasks with ease, adapting the system to your unique workflow rather than forcing you to conform to rigid structures.
The clean interface allows you to categorize tasks, set priorities, and establish deadlines without unnecessary complexity. As your needs evolve, so does our platformâ€”modify task attributes, adjust deadlines, or completely restructure your organization system with just a few clicks.
Technology Stack
Frontend

React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a component-based architecture for efficient UI development and state management
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development with predefined classes for styling components
Redux: State management library for maintaining application-wide state
Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to the backend
React Router: For navigation and routing between different views

Backend

Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment that executes server-side code
Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js that simplifies API creation and middleware integration
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing task data, user information, and application settings
Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB that provides schema validation and database interaction
JSON Web Tokens (JWT): For secure authentication and authorization

Architecture
The application follows a standard MERN architecture:

Client Layer: React application bundled with Webpack that communicates with the backend API
API Layer: Express.js routes that handle HTTP requests from the client
Service Layer: Business logic and data processing
Data Access Layer: Mongoose models and queries for database operations
Database: MongoDB collections for tasks, users, and settings

Data Flow

User interacts with the React frontend
React components dispatch actions based on user input
API calls are made to Express.js endpoints
Backend validates requests and performs database operations via Mongoose
MongoDB stores or retrieves the requested data
Response is sent back to the frontend
React updates the UI accordingly
